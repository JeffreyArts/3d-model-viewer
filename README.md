# About

This project is used to generate a 3D view of an STL model. You can rotate it with the mouse or via touch events and reset the position to the home position with the button in the top right corner. While it is a technically working project, it is meant to generate a HTML template that can be utilized by other programs to create these 3D model viewers that can be included via iframes# 3d-model-viewer
